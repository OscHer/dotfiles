# Dotfiles

Accesible way to get and deploy my most used dotfiles

## Assets
### Vim
> "I'll give up my Vim when you take it from my cold, dead hands"

Includes:
* [abbreviation.vim](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Use_abbreviations_for_frequently-used_words)
* [spl files](https://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/spell.html)

Note that despite this is a *dotfiles* repository, we won't be using '.' before any file.

## Appendix

### Roadmap

* Ansible playbook to [treboform](https://github.com/OscHer/treboform) any VM.

#### Maybe
I haven't made up my mind yet about these features.
